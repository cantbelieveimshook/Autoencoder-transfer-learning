# README
This folder consists of a saved pre-trained autoencoder and code for the baseline model, the autoencoder, and the classification model that uses autoencoder weights. The pipeline and results for the baseline model are located in Autoencoder_benchmarking.iypnb. It is a classification model that has the exact same architecture as the autoencoder transfer model that is mentioned in the paper, except instead of using weights pre-trained from an autoencoder, the weights are randomly initialized and the model is trained from scratch.

The pre-trained autoencoder, which is named "best_model," along with the code for both the autoencoder and classification models are located in the Autoencoder Transfer folder.
