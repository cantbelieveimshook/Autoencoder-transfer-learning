# README
# The baseline model is located in Autoencoder_benchmarking.iypnb. It is a classification model that has the exact same architecture as the autoencoder transfer model that is mentioned in the paper, except instead of using weights pre-trained from an autoencoder, the weights are randomly initialized and the model is trained from scratch.
# The pre-trained autoencoder, along with the code for both the autoencoder and classification models are located in the Autoencoder Transfer folder.
